# Data Science in the Wild

At this point, you might get tired of me emphasizing the decision-making aspect of data science as the main point of why it is important. It's time we move from the general and abstact towards particular examples and applications in various industries. This will lead us to acknowledge how **prevalent** is AI (that we haven't fully defined yet) in firms, services and technologies we use every day. 

::: {.callout-important}
## During a lecture, I usually ask students
Can you give some examples of businesses, sevices, technologies, problems, and domains which you suspect do have AI/ML algorithms and models behind the scenes?

See below some very good answers and argumentations provided by the students last year, then we'll examine in more details one of them. Of course, there is always that one person, very passionate about sports or blockchain.

## Do some reverse engineering!

When reading this section, I want to get you into a mindset of the reverse engineer: step back and think deeply about products and services you use every day:

- Put yourself in the shoes of the business making those decisions and building those systems
- What were the goals, user/client needs?
- What was the firm's objective?
- What constraints did they hit? Why it was a difficult problem?
- What made it an appropriate use-case for ML, Statistics, and AI?
- What are some potential approaches they settled on?
- What would be a baseline, simple, naive solution?
:::



- **Dynamic pricing** in Bolt and Uber, which takes into account the weather, especially if it rains, peak hours: balancing demand and supply. It is at the intersection of ML and economic theory, as they are a platform or marketplace. Prices also change with respect to competitors, so we see aspects of an oligopoly behavior. [^uber_jack]  
- **Stock markets** and trading bots: at the intersection of economics, finance and AI. I would add the "good old" and boring portfolio management and venture capital enterprises.
- **Management consulting**: what market to enter, whether and how to build a new product (product development). Lots of use-cases in marketing and market research firms.
- **Medicine Applications**: developing new vaccines and drugs, aided by AI and designing clinical trials for novel treatments.
- **Banks and insurance**: risk management, predicting credit defaults on mortgages and business loans. Chatbots for customer support, for most frequent and simple questions.
- **Automotive**: routine tasks like automated parking, the race towards self-driving, autonomous or semi-autonomous cars, safety warnings. Predictive maintainance is tackling a problem where they leverage predictions to replace risky parts before they go out of function.
- Liverpool F.C. won a title, and a key part of their success was leveraging AI and ML to discover new tactis on the field with the highest payoffs. [^liverpool]
- **NBA** teams invested a lot in the data infrastructure and decision-making capabilities: LA Lakers found the best player at the moment for a particular position they were lacking and would play well along with the team. Rockets won the regular championship divison by going all in on the 3-point shot.[^rockets] Golden State Warriors simply revolutionised basketball with data, before everyone else was doing it -- giving them a competitive edge. [^nba]

[^uber_jack]: When it doesn't work out -- I'm pretty upset at their data scientists and domain experts. Here is where ethical issues creep up: jacking up prices, monopolies, drivers struggling to make a living wage.

[^liverpool]: TODO: Reference article and maybe dataset for more details
[^nba]: Check out the following [video by The Economist](https://youtu.be/oUvvfHkXyOA) on how data transformed the NBA. For more details on the statistical methodology, I enjoyed an youtube channel called Thinking Basketball and their [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pznoCFs7XZg&list=PLtzZl14BrKjTJZdubjNEY5jU0fGOiy51x) about the statistical methodology.
[^rockets]: [Moreyball: The Houston Rockets and Analytics](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/moreyball-the-houston-rockets-and-analytics/) -- an article in Harvard's MBA Digital Innovation

In all of the examples above, those businesses and systems do have to make decisions, under uncertainty from multiple sources, trying to solve complex problems at a large scale, which would be impossible to do manually even with an army of employees. 

I would like to add a few more examples, from an insider and practitioner's perspective, which might not be as impressive and a bit routine, but no less important. Keep in mind, that if at a closer look, the service seems to do something relatively intelligent very fast, specialized AI might be involved behind the scenes.

- **Demand Planning**: How many SKUs (items) should I order for manufacturing, to satisfy the demand (that last item on the shelf, minimizing lost sales) and to minimize excess inventory.
- **Logistics** and **Supply Chain**: routing, distribution center operations and automations for order fulfillment, return management
- **Recommender systems** for music, videos, books, products, news in social media, services, platforms, and e-commerces like facebook, instagram, tiktok, youtube, spotify, amazon, emag. You can find recommendations in surprising places, like google maps.
- **Programmatic Advertisement**: finding best placement for ads on various platforms, right now dominated by meta and google

## Classroom Case Studies for a Deeper Understanding

We will explore some challenges and applications from this list in a series of case studies and labs. The idea is to improve our ability to identify opportunities and formulate problems from the point of view of an organisation, such that we can match those with the methods, models and algorithms discussed in the course. 

I'll have to introduce a lot of new concepts when the language we developed so far will turn out to be insufficient to talk about and understand what's happening inside these firms. Thus, each case study is an opportunity to play around with a novel idea. [^skip-to-cases]

- In the first deep-dive, we will look at Uber and Bolt, with publicly available information, trying to figure out what do their data scientists do. 
- Then, we will look at the lingerie e-commerce where I work at, AdoreMe and a different set of problems we're facing.
:::

[^skip-to-cases]: If you have a pretty good idea about what is AI, Analytics, ML, Deep Learning, Big Data, Causal Inference and when to use one approach or another, feel free to skip the history and terminology and go straight to the case studies.



# Business Performance and Strategy

Arguably, we live in a *volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous* world that we have to understand in order to navigate it well. By "world", I mean the economy, society, environment, or any other complex system -- especially when human behavior is involved. It is reasonable to ask: wasn't it always the case, depending on how we define the terms, level of analysis, and point of view? 

I think it's a matter of scale and magnitude in VUCA dimensions, where an accelerating rate of change poses a great challenge to our capacity to adapt. Instead of an evolutionary or philosophical comment on why we need this field of data/decision science, I have two questions on my mind when it comes to living well or improving business outcomes: **what is true** and **how should I act**? [^general]

[^general]: This implies that we already framed the problem and figured out what we want to achieve, and that indeed we chose the right goals and objectives. Moreover, the questions of epistemiology and ethics are a never ending topic for discussion and enquiry.


:::: {.callout-tip}
## Decision Science: (not only) truth and action

Let's start from a business setting of an e-commerce, where we want to increase sales, customer satisfaction, and reduce costs. Imagine three scenarios, which neatly fall into the SWOT framework:

![*Source: [Kim Warren](https://strategydynamics.com/free/assets/The%20Dynamics%20of%20Strategy,%202016.pdf)* - Status Quo, Desired and Feared Trajectories](01_fundamentals/img/trajectories.png){width="60%"}



- We keep the status quo, doing everyting as before. What is the most likely trajectory of profits? Can we come up with an educated guess? If the trajectory looks good, that is our **strenghts** and compentencies contributing to it, if not, our **weakness**.
- A feared trajectory, that is, if our business is hit by a shock in supply chain, inflation, by competition or customer demand. It's the **threats**.
- A desired or aspirational trajectory. Is it reasonable and realistically achievable? If yes, what strategy and tactics should we implement, how sould we act? This is our **opportunity**.
::::

After this exercise, we defined more precisely where we stand, that is, quantify the current state of the firm. We framed the problem in terms of most relevant outcomes and we're in the process of figuring out what are the optimal goals to aim for. Obviously, we need a mechanism, measurements to know that we're on track and to recognize when we get there. Now, let's go back to our two questions and unpack them:

- **What is true?** In the most general sense, we're not asking for a mathematical and logical truth, but if it's plausible, probable, deserves serious consideration, is backed by evidence. I also mean that we understand the underlying causal mechanisms. Not least, an assessment of the current situation. The metaphor which I suggest for this is "seeing clearly", through the fog, illusions, and biases. [^scout]
- **How should I act?** What is plausible doesn't entirely answer this question, we can't derive an ought from is.[^hume] In business settings, I would think about action in terms of strategic alignment and optimisation.

The only missing pieces from this mental model that I argue for is tremendously important: **iteration** and **feedback**. Due to VUCA, we can't be sure our actions are optimal, or even that we're solving the right problem, therefore fast iteration and feedback ensures we're not taking too much risk, that we find out early about problems in our thinking and action, that we can change course to steer the ship back on track.

::: {.callout-note}
## Wait, this sounds familiar

Sounds an awflul lot like Cybernetics, doesn't it? Especially if we have the idea of a firm as a complex adaptive system as a pressuposition for this discussion.
:::

[^hume]: This is one of the most important and applicable philosophical ideas, introduced by David Hume: when one makes claims about what ought to be that are based solely on statements about what is.

[^scout]: Recommended reading: Scout Mindset by Julia Galef




<!-- You might've heard in the news that data scientist is the sexiest job of 21st century, that AI is going to take over, Deep Reinforcement Learning models are beating people at Dota and Chess, solving almost-impossible protein-folding problems. But what does it actually mean, if we step outside the hype/buzzwords, use a plain language, and apply these ideas in a more down-to-earth, day-to-day problems and challenges in businesses? -->

Now that it's more clear what I meant in the course introduction by improving business outcomes and bringing value to organizations, I didn't yet explain what does analytics, data science, machine learning, and AI do or are, and how to they fit in the picture we painted so far.



## What is Strategy?

Sounds like a naive question, but bad strategy is prevalent -- which comes from a misunderstanding about what is a strategy. I highly recommend [this article published by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-perils-of-bad-strategy) -- we learn better from other's mistakes.

In short, it is not just **aspiration** towards goal or having a **vision** or setting a **target**. By analogy, remember the SMART criteria when you're setting goals. As true consultants, we can summarize the steps involved in developing a strategy in a matrix.

| Step | Outcome | Characteristics
|------|-------|------|
| Honest diagnosis | Identify obstacles |     Few critical, relevant aspects
| Guiding policy |  General approach to overcome | Focused on key aspects
| Coherent actions | Support policy with action plan   |  Coordinated and focused


Since strategy informs so much of decision-making, know your firm's strategy -- ask around, understand it, contribute to it. Call out bad strategy.




## Module 1: Business School and Methodology

Remember the advice "think of yourself as a business person with superpowers"? It means that as a decision scientist, it's helpful to think question, action, and outcome first -- and only then about models. In other words, we have to deeply understand our client's business domain and **problem space**.  The best way to achieve that, is experience and collaboration on the job. Therefore, my role is to tell as many stories from the trenches, so that you know what to expect in practice.

A good starting place is thinking about the purpose of a business from different perspectives.  Then, identify key decisions that firms have to make across many industries and domains. This exercise will show us how widespread are data science applications and use-cases, even in places we don't suspect. 

At this point it is important to clarify what we mean by AI, ML, analytics, data mining, statistics and when is it appropriate to choose one approach over another. You'll be surprised, but statistics is the hardest to define and often misunderstood, because of its inferential, experimental, and causal facets.

Next, we'll learn a few frameworks for understanding a firm's performance evolution, value chain, strategy and tie them all together in an analyst's workflow. These tools will help us ask good (statistical) questions and increase the chances that our modeling efforts result in actionable insights.  

::: {.column-margin} 
In time, I'll add many more case-studies from advertisement, promotion, merchandising, engagement, CRM, conversion rate optimization, demand planning, supply chain, etc.
:::

An essential aid in this pursuit of improving decision-making at scale, are different processes and **methodologies** for machine learning, experiment design, causal inference, and exploratory data analysis. It is important to mention that methodology is not a recipe, but way of structuring our work, a set of guiding principles and constraints over the space of all the things that we could do in analysis. Don't think of these constraints as limiting your freedom, but as helpful allies in effective problem problem solving.

These methodolgical fundamentals are not "just theory", it is what will make or break projects in practice. There are so many pitfalls in ML and statistics that we cannot afford to do it ad-hoc. In my teaching, I try very hard to bring back the scientific process and methodology into "data science". Understanding and applying a statistical tool or model by itself is not sufficient. We need case-studies in which we put the business context, decisions, domain understanding, and working software at the forefront. As R. McElreath sais, science before statistics! 

::: {.callout-warning}
## Why most AI/ML projects fail?

A lot of attention has been paid in the industry to the software engineering aspects of machine learning as one of the causes of failed projects. In the last 5 years, a lot of tools and best practices have emerged which can help us mitigate those risks and increase our chances of successful operationalization.

In my opinion, a bigger problem is methodological and organizational: a mismatch between business objectives, actions, constraints, tradeoffs, domain specificities vs modeling. This is why the ability to ask good questions, to formulate a problem, and think scientifically is critical. Therefore, an important goal of my writing is to recognize and avoid **adhockery**. ^[Adhockery in modeling, in product-management, in data-mining, and software engineering] 

There is one more problem you have to be aware of, which I call the "Kaggle phenomenon". Despite Kaggle competitions being an excellent platform for honing ML skills and developing better models, I think it gave too many people the impression that this is what data science is about. Kaggle misses the most important aspects of problem-solving and it is devoid of most of the original business context and decision-making.

:::


If you worry that the business school is too conceptual -- don't despair, as we'll have a few hands-on, technical lectures -- involving math, modeling, and programming. We will come back to these problems after getting the required background in probability and statistical modeling.

- I use the newsvendor problem as a starting point in modeling and optimization for demand planning
- The pricing optimization as a starting point towards revenue management



::: {.callout-tip}
## Go to "Study Guide" pages for practice!

Conceptual understanding by itself is not enough. So, I curated a list of resources to practice on interesting case-studies, datasets, which directly apply the models, tools, and methodologies presented. These are written by experts in the field, are usually well thought, easy to follow, reproducible, and highlight important aspects of a problem and model.

Also, keep an eye on the course [github repo](https://github.com/Bizovi/decision-making), in which we'll do a lot of simulations, some exciting projects (full stack data apps) and investigate common challenges with a fresh perspective.
:::


In the study guide we go into more details and granularity -- with references, readings, and practices for particular topics within each lecture. I suggest to read about the [course philosophy](../philosophy.qmd), which motivates why it is structured in this way. If you're unsure about the prerequisites and background knowledge, refer to ["Why did you study all of that?"](prerequisites.qmd).

::: {.column-margin}

Some lectures are conceptual and you might go into more depth by reading. Some are highly technical and you want to go through the math and practice/code on suggested case-studies.

## Introduction and course overview

First, make sure you read the [introduction](../index.qmd#module-1-business-school-for-data-scientists) for a motivation and brief summary of what are we going to study, then review the [schedule and syllabus](roadmap.qmd#module-i-business-school-for-data-scientists) in order to understand how the course is structured in particular lectures.

::: {.column-margin}
If you're a student, please, don't skip the readings in the first two lectures. These are perhaps the most important learnings from 10 years of practice and will serve you well.
:::

- Understand the particularities of decision-making in businesses
- Why I prefer "decision science" over "data science"
- Necessary admin stuff and project requirements. Think about your goals, aspirations, interests and hobbies, so that you can pick a fun use-case
- Go through the slides again after the readings and lectures

::: {.callout-tip}
## Activity: What is the purpose of the business?

On the card you received in the class, answer the following questions:

- Answer from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to each to the possible purposes (raison d'etre) of a busines.
- Are you considering to start a business in the next 5 years?

Now, imagine you're in charge of public policy, or take part of an entreprenorial think-tank or NGO for youths. Formulate a research question that a further study would try to answer. It doesn't have to relate to the particular questions you answered before.
:::

::: {.column-margin}
If you're serious about data science and statistical fundamentals, I highly recommend the following two books by A. Gelman for self study: [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html) and [Active Statistics](https://avehtari.github.io/ActiveStatistics/index.html)
:::

## Business context, decisions, and strategy

I build upon the previous lecture to develop the story of decisions in a business environment. We need additional terminology, concepts, and models in order to structure the problem space. What is key here, is to get immersed and **put yourself in the shoes** of decision-makers. Read the [second chapter](2_performance_strategy.qmd).

- Evolution of firm's performance in time. Why, Where, How? [^strat-dyn]
    - Status quo, desired, and feared trajectories. 
    - Tradeoffs and limited resources, SWOT Analysis
- A deep-dive into Business Analyst's Workflow
- What is strategy? What makes good or bad strategy? [^perils-strat]
- What is a Value Chain? Data Science Strategy Safari [^strat-safari]

[^strat-dyn]: Read Kim Warren's article on "The Dynamics of Strategy" [here](https://strategydynamics.com/free/assets/The%20Dynamics%20of%20Strategy,%202016.pdf)

[^perils-strat]: Read the article published in McKinsey by Richard Rumelt ["The perils of bad strategy"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-perils-of-bad-strategy)

[^strat-safari]: Read about the framework of aligning business objectives to data science use-cases. Data Science Strategy Safari at [bayesianquest](https://bayesianquest.com/2018/11/13/data-science-strategy-safari-aligning-data-science-strategy-to-org-strategy/)


::: {.callout-note}
## Survey of use-cases in various domains 

As a second activity, think about as many domains and use-cases as possible in which AI and data science plays an important role. Put yourself in the shoes of the firm: how would you reverse-engineer the product? Then, see what resonates with you [here](1_applications.qmd)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: LRB Subscriptions

Take a subscription-based publication like [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/) and analyze it using the tools and frameworks you learned.

Think about acquisition, churn, printing, transportation, and market share. How can it grow? What would make it profitable? What are the key decisions to be made?
:::


::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: Food Stamps and Fermi Estimation

There is a good reason why management consultants practice Fermi Estimation (sanity, order-of-magnitude checks) and it is asked in many interviews. 

Take a look at the case study on [Food Stamp Fraud](https://callingbullshit.org/case_studies/case_study_foodstamp_fraud.html) by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West in Calling Bullshit. Practice on other classical Fermi estimtion examples.
:::

## Decision-making under uncertainty at scale

In the previous lecture we learned how data science fits into the larger context of a business. The ideas of value chain and business analyst's workflow are immediately applicable in practice. Now, read the [third chapter](4_ml_stats.qmd).

- Clarify what I mean by AI and Cybernetics and the historical confusion [^jordan]
- When do we need Analytics vs Statistics vs Machine Learning?
- A note on interdisciplinarity and thinking in buckets
- Agents, environments, and sources of uncertainty 


[^jordan]: K. Pretz, "[Stop Calling Everything AI](https://spectrum-ieee-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/spectrum.ieee.org/amp/stop-calling-everything-ai-machinelearning-pioneer-says-2652904044), Machine-Learning Pioneer Says"; M. Jordan, "[Artificial  Intelligence](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1/release/9) - The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet"

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: DTC Fashion E-Commerces

Choose a direct-to-consumer e-commerce, like Zara, H&M, or a marketplace like Zalando (the big players in the oligopoly). How does a potential business strategy look like? What are some use-cases for Data Science / AI which can improve their outcomes?
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: Uber and Dynamic Pricing

In the case of Uber, Bolt (ride sharing platforms), we're very much interested in same questions as before, however, we need to get a grasp on the idea of market-making. If you were to reverse-engineer the pricing algorithms, how would you go about doing it?

:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Overview of **open datasets**

It is very hard to find good, realistic datasets which map well on representative use-cases from this course. This is why I curated a list of public datasets in a variety of domains. These should help if you don't know where to start your project, that is don't have particular problems, hypotheses, or research questions in mind.
:::

## Newsvendor Problem and Demand Planning

Demand planning, especially demand forecasting and inventory optimization is an obvious and widespread application of the models and methods from the course. The newsvendor problem is a good way to get started in this area of businesses.

In the economics' courses you might've solved this problem analytically, under strong assumptions, but we have a huge problem of trying to quantify and take into account the uncertainty. Therefore, we rely on simulation, motivate the need for statistical inference and optimization algorithms. [^newsvendor]

[^newsvendor]: There is an excellent presentation of the newsvendor problem by Adam Fleischhacker in [Chapter 3](https://www.persuasivepython.com/2-decisionanalysis) and [Chapter 5](https://www.persuasivepython.com/4-multidimarrays) of "Persuasive Python". [Chapter 20](https://www.causact.com/intro#intro) of his Business Analytics book contains another classic economic problem interpreted in modern way. If you prefer, there is a [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsSPnwWS_M) on the newsvendor.

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: TIME INC. printing

In the paper ["Newsvendors Tackle the Newsvendor Problem"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20141257), Koschat, Berk et. al. show how an analysis and optimization of printing decisions led to TIME INC. to revise its policies and generate additional $\$3.5m$ in profit.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: Restaurant Data and Project Ideas 

Besides Persuasive Python, you can find an alternative case-study on ["Yaz" restaurant data](https://opimwue.github.io/ddop/tutorial_modules/tutorial.html), which makes playing around with the newsvendor problem easy, due to its Python package. 
:::

For an academic paper with a meta-analysis of data-driven approaches to the newswendor problem, check out [S. Buttler, A. Philippi](https://ml-eval.github.io/assets/pdf/ICLR22_Workshop_ML_Eval_DDNV.pdf). If you have a demand planning use-case at work, the best resources are written by N. Vandeput and I. Svetunkov's CMAF seminars.


##  Price optimization under limited capacity 

In contrast with the newsvendor problem (where prices were fixed), it's time we focus on pricing decisions. The limited capacity of airplane seats, concert tickets, hotel rooms, on the one hand simplifies the problem formulation, but introduces many complexities in practice.

This seemingly simple problem motivates why the young field of revenue management was created. When forecasting the demand, we need to think about how to model it well [^modeling] and take into account most relevant factors influencing it. This is where we have to be careful, or at least aware of what economic theory has to say about demand elasticity, competition, and price discrimination.

On the optimization side, we will keep things simple, as in the newsvendor problem. We will not go into the complexities of dynamic programming.


::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: Concerts, Events, and Airlines

We can use the Kaggle simulator for dynamic pricing in the airline industry, get creative with the Mercari Challenge or other open datasets. There isn't a firm which will make such kind of data public, so we need to get creative in how we simulate, estimate, or collect the data from what is available.

Adam Fleischhacker has an excellent [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScjq1mkDc0) (Chapter 24: Compelling Decisions and Actions Under Uncertainty) which is a good starting point.

:::

[^modeling]: This is where what we learn in [Module 3](../references.qmd): Applied Bayesian Statistics, especially the hierarchical models help a lot.



## Churn and Lifetime Value. Open datasets

Customer retention and repurchase is what makes or breaks businesses, especially in the past few years, with so many subscription and SAAS business models. Therefore, this topic deserves a full lecture -- to cover the contractual and PAYG/non-contractual settings.

I show that predicting churn and remaining customer lifetime value is not just a simple classification / regression problem. First, we need some tools from survival analysis and second -- what we really want to know is who can be convinced to remain by an intervention, like promotions or loyalty programs. [^convince]

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: BTYD models (Buy till you die)

There is a body of work spanning two decades by Bruce Hardie and Peter Fader, who developed statistical models that estimate the remaining LTV (Lifetime Value) of customers, which depends on their survival/activity and repurchase patterns.

We will implement a model for contractual and non-contractual settings on the limited data available on the web. Luckily, that would be sufficient to apply them for your own use-cases.
:::


Last, but not least, I present an overview of curated open datasets from various sources, organized by industry -- which should serve as an inspiration for future practice and your project. There is a shortlist of the ones I found most intriguing and representative, then a long tail of alternatives and fun stuff.

In previous courses you probably did a lot of exploratory data analysis. It is a skill which demands lots of practice and experience in order to do it well (finding inspiration and interesting patterns in data). Having a methodology for EDA helps, however, in practice we have to work with databases.

::: {.callout-note}
## Case-Study: DuckDB and e-commerce database

I use a relational dataset from a real e-commerce which was made public in Kaggle, in order to showcase how to interact with databases and highlight the importance of knowing SQL. 

We use a recent innovation in databases, duckDB, which allows us to have an analytic, in-process database, with almost zero setup or dependencies. Once the e-commerce data is loaded and modeled inside the DB, we can start cleaning it, putting it all together, and extracting insights from it. This particular dataset is very rich in information and lends itself well to open-ended investigations. 

:::


[^convince]: This is a good opportunity to introduce the idea of Uplift and Calibration of classification scores returned by a ML model.
