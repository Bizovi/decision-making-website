title: "Module I: Business School for Data Scientists"
---



The "business school" emphasizes again and again the idea of **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty at Scale**, across many industries and use-cases. We walk through three perspectives: Analytics, Machine Learning, and Statistics -- then develop processes for each one. This module is heavy on methodology, since I want to [bring back science into "data science"]{.underline}, but don't worry, there will be enough case-studies.

## A selection of realistic datasets

Deciding what topic, domain, and problem to choose for your project is a daunting task in itself. During the course, I present new tools to formulate good questions and how to design your research study. Unfortunately, in most cases, we will be limited by what open data is available. We encounter the same problem of "too much content": there is so much data to work with, but most of it isn't any good for our purposes.

You can rely entirely on simulation, but the way you desing the underlying data-generating process has to be very well thought out, informed by the specificities of the problem and an expectation of what data we'll encounter in practice.

Finding good data about business challenges is incredibly hard, since few firms will be open to sharing it. Even when we get our hands on a good kaggle competition, the problem is that the data has been already framed, curated, and put together for us. This means that we don't get the real experience of end-to-end problem solving that we would encounter in practice. Therefore, I collected a list of datasets which are realistic and diverse enough. You can consider them as an inspiration and starting point.

The curated list of datasets doesn't appear in most books and resources that I recommend. The challenges they present are not easy and require quite a lot of work. Some of them will also teach you how to work with larger amounts of data. That said, there is still a lot of value in the didactic examples, so here are a few more directions I recommend to look into:

- P. Fader, B. Hardie, and E. Ascarza research on BTYD (buy till you die) models of customer repurchase behavior, churn, and LTV
- This [website](https://www.bnlearn.com/research/) on Bayesian networks has a few amazing case-studies on self-worth and depression, which are perfect for practicing causal thinking
- Facebook has synthesised the recent research in Marketing Mix Modeling into their open-source project called Robyn.
- Rohan Alexander has a good example of multilevel modeling with post-stratification on US 2020 [elections](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/15-mrp.html). Andrew Gelman in "Regression and other stories" has lots of great examples from political and social science.
