This study guide is designed as a complementary resource to "Simulation of economic processes". It provides additional references for studying and practicing the fundamentals of probability and statistics.

It's possible you didn't enjoy your statistics classes. This happened in my case, despite a passion for the field. In this journey of decision science, we have to give statistics another chance, but we dramatically change the strategy of how we learn it. We'll heavily use simulations, stories, and case-studies which highlight the practical relevance of key theoretical ideas.^[Just flip through a modern book which takes a similar approach to get a sense of how different it looks from traditional teaching.]  Speegle's [Probability, Statistics, and Data: A fresh approach using R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/preface.html) and  Cetinkaya-Runde's [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/index.html) are excellent examples of this new way of teaching.

There is absolutely no shame in going back to a subject again with a mindset of mastering the fundamentals. For me, this exercise turned out to be one of the most valuable things I've done.

## Probability theory

First, read the [introductory chapter](/sim/1_intro.qmd) in which I explain how probability fits in the larger context of decision science and how can we use simulation to learn and appreciate it better. I highly recommend these [lectures](https://www.santoshvenkatesh.com/video-lectures) by Santosh A. Venkatesh (SV) and Joseph Blitzstein's [Probability 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) course (JB) as your main references for probability theory.

### Combinatorics and sampling

In the [first lab](/sim/1L_bday_problem.qmd), where we simulated the [birthday problem]{.underline}, I mentioned the importance of knowing the stories behind core concepts in combinatorics, like ${n \choose k}$ "n choose k", factorial, falling factorial, and the multiplication rule. They translate into urn models and sampling procedures (ordered, unordered, with and without replacement).

 The first three lectures from SV and JB should be more than sufficient as a review of combinatorics and naive probability.^[Pay close attention to their story proofs and the effort they put in to get you over the fear of mathematical abstraction] In the latter you will see how urn models were successfully applied in modeling different phenomena in physics.

## Rabbit hole: unordered sampling with replacement

In S. Venkatesh, Tableau 3, there is an elegant proof of unordered sampling with replacement, which was used by Bose and Einstein to describe the behavior of bosons. The result will be useful to us when we'll introduce bootstrap, but you can check out a neat [explanation](https://rpubs.com/riazakhan94/bootstrap_distinct_sample) by Riaz Khan.
:::

I understand if your reaction at this point is: "Are you kidding me, this is just a warm-up?". I would like to convince you that the time investment is not that big and the payoff is huge. You will encounter fun stories and applications in multiple domains, get comfortable with mathematical abstraction, and see that probability doesn't have to be a chore or just a prerequisite you have to get over with.

## Rabbit hole: the hot hand strikes again

You might've heard about the hot hand fallacy. We model streaks of successful shots in basketball and ask whether streaks of $k$ are surprising. Read the original paper by Kahneman and Tversky and ignore the statistical test they designed.

Their insight that fans and experts in basketball massively overestimate the magnitude of this effect is fundamentally correct. However, what doesn't follow from their research is that there is no effect, which is pointed out by a few Bayesian statisticians in the recent years. The debate goes on, but the limitations of the original statistical test are undeniable

This is a true rabbit hole. Right now, we have the tools to simulte what can we expect if there was no effect or a small effect, but we can't design a statistical test yet. For that, refer to the last section in Tableau 10 of S. Venkatesh, Kahneman's original paper, and recent papers which challenge the statistical methodology and modeling approach based on which the original conclusion was reached.
:::

Despite the ongoing debate about the magnitude of the effect in the hot hand phenomenon, it is undeniable that such simulations are extremely valuable -- they prevent us from be fooled by randomness. Let's look at a few more examples:

- amateur traders might see "winning" patterns in stock markets which can be explained by a random walk
- policy-makers might not realize that amazing SAT performances in some schools with few students could be just due to small sample sizes
- in chess, some might attribute an observed pattern of ELO by gender to nonsensical explanations, when a simple simulation will show that an initial disparity in the number of players, combined with estimating a proportion in top k overall players results in similar patters.
- pollers might underestimate the support for a political party due to differential non-response
- medical research might overestimate the effectiveness of a treatment due to drop-out and censoring
- we might think there is an association between variables, when both can be explained by a common cause, a confounder


## Probability Triple. Random Variables. Statistical Models

If you understand and can explain the above ideas in a simple, yet rigorous way  -- you're ready for the journey. Otherwise, if it feels shaky[^shaky], here are some readings:

- Probability Triple and Random Variables - a quasi formal introduction is written in [this chapter](https://course.economic-cybernetics.com/01_fundamentals/stat_foundations.html) of the course website. From my experience, not many students have this understanding after their probability theory classes.
- Collectivity ("physical" structure), Statistical Population, Sample. We need to be a bit more precise in what we mean by a statistical model and a DGP. 
    - Defining the population and sampling process is a critical step in statistics. 
    - The population is the "contract" we're bound to when talking about inferences
    - It is a much more nuanced topic than it looks, explained well [here](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design.html) and [here](https://crumplab.com/statistics/04-SamplesPopulations.html).
- Parameter (Estimand), Estimator, Estimation/Statistic. Never confuse those! 


[^shaky]: Some of you might find reviewing this insulting because it's "trivial", or useless theory, or a frustrating reminder of probability classes. Please, bear with me -- because we will eliminate a whole class of errors practitioners make by not keeping these things in mind.

## Hypotheses, Process models, Statistical models

Some of the biggest debates in science, spanning across decades and causing much confusion and controversy could've been resolved much quicker by having this explicit distinction about Scientific Hypotheses, Process Models, and Statistical Models or procedures. 

I highly recommend this first [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs) by Richard McElreath, showing how tricky could it be to map the correspondences between these three.

## Newsvendor problem. Stories behind distributions

You studied the properties of a whole zoo of probability distributions, but then, in statistics, encountered just a few -- especially in the context of hypothesis testing. In Module 3 (Applied Bayesian Statistics) we will need to know the stories[^stories] behind most of them, since the goal will be to build custom models for each application. 

[^stories]: There are particular physical processes and phenomena (stories, in general) which underly the patterns we observe. Often, those patterns can be accurately described by a particular probability distribution, governed by its parameters

- Bernoulli, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Negative Binomial [^prob-simulations]
- Poisson. Limiting and Conditioning. Overdispersion
- Beta, Gamma, Exponential. Exponential Family and Information Theory
- Statistical superstars: $\chi^2_k$,  $t_k$, $N(\mu, \sigma)$, $F(d_1, d_2)$
- Weirdos: Mixtures, Dirichlet, Multinomial, Weibull, heavy tails
- Remember the differences between PMF, PDF, CDF, MGF, $\mathbb{E}$, $\mathbb{V}$, $\mathbb{E}g(x)$


[^prob-simulations]: Look at some [examples with simulations](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#simulationsprob) and [stories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/view) / applications with more math from Joe Blitzstein.


::: {.callout-note}
## Poisson and the Prussian army

Originally, Poisson distribution was used to estimate deaths by horses in the Prussian Army. Here is the [historical data](https://rpubs.com/SmilodonCub/567089) and a [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/poisson-distribution-from-horse-kick-history-data-to-modern-analytic-5eb49e60fb5f) telling the story.
:::

I limit the number of hands-on applications for this chapter/lecture, not only because of time constraints, but also because most use-cases come in Module 3, in the context of more realistic problems. I hope, however, that I sparked an interest about how to approach Probability, especially when we draw DAGs to tell stories.


## The most dangerous equation. CLT

Halfway in the module, we switch from Probability Theory to Mathematical Statistics. The goal is to develop the fundamentals needed for applied statistics, designing randomized experiments, and even machine learning. [^4]

- We continue with the key idea of estimators and sampling distributions, review laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem. See simulations [here](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/SimulationRV.html#centrallimittheorem).
- If you're interested in the underlying theory, I go on a technical detour about convergence types: in probability, in distribution, and almost-sure
- What does a statistician want? Review important properties of estimators.
    - For an accessible explanation of Bias, Consistency, Efficiency -- showcased with the corresponding R code, see [openforecast](https://openforecast.org/sba/estimatesProperties.html)

[^4]: Although the perspective I take in Module 3 is Bayesian, I will take time in Module 2 to cover and re-contextualize the Neyman-Pearson frequentism

::: {.callout-note}
## The most dangerous equation

I think that ["The most dangerous equation"](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8863.pdf) is a must read for anyone, not just practicing scientists and statisticians. The example I usually do a demonstration on is about the dubious U.S. policy of splitting the bigger schools.

## Calling Bullshit: Best Barbecue

Continuing on the reddit examples, there are some amazing case-studies in the "Calling Bullshit" website and book. One of them is exactly such a ranking problem: [best barbecue in the states](https://www.callingbullshit.org/case_studies/case_study_barbecue.html). I recommend you watch the whole playlist and work through the case studies: it is fun and an essential skill -- to call out the bullshit.

Online platforms which have to rank posts and comments, face the challenges of how to take the sample size into account. It depends, but for inspiration, see the hackernoon ranking algorithm.

## Conditioning and Bayes Rule

There is a quote I like a lot: "Conditioning is the soul of statistics". The Bayes rule, which follows directly from the axioms of probability, is an essential in decision-making and the most important tool in this course -- both conceptually and technically. Any introduction to the subject will work out:

- A few excellent resources are Chapter 1/2 of [BDA3](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), or Chapter 1/2 of [Bayes Rules](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-2.html), or Chapter 1/2 of [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). They will teach you about:
    - Conditioning, Marginalization, Priors, and Updating
- If you prefer videos, enjoy the 3Blue1Brown [visual masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM) on how to think like a Bayesian or the explanation [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/R6nV5/bayesian-thinking).
- I introduce the idea of Likelihood, which would serve us in future use-cases. It is another important perspective over statistical modeling to consider

::: {.callout-note}
## Medical testing for rare diseases
**Medical testing** for rare diseases, hypothetical example with code in my [course repository](https://github.com/Bizovi/decision-making/blob/main/playground/02_bayes.ipynb). We use the same idea to reason about how confident are we our code has no bugs.

If you remember the Covid-19 rapid tests and their confusion matrices printed on instructions, you could've applied the same idea!

:::

::: {.column-margin}
Or maybe you're passionate about biology, where you could apply it for Mendelian genetics and think about the mystery of deadly genes persistence
:::

For the simplest models, one approach of comparing different hypotheses is Bayes Factors. However, these do not translate well in practice for more sophisticated, multilevel models. You can look it up in the following courses [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/supplement/IPkZK/assignment-2-2-bayesian-statistics) and [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian/home/week/3) for the theory and examples.

## Football spreads and betting experts

(BDA3, Ch1): **Football spreads**, that can be estimated from [data about matches](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/data/football.asc). What is the probability that a team wins? Are experts right, on average?

- If you're into betting and sports, can you replicate the analysis on other datasets? What are your options for data collection?
- For brevity, I won't elaborate much from now on, how to take an use-case and example to its limit. **If you're passionate about a particular topic -- go for it!**

:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Spelling Correction

(BDA3, Ch1): **Spelling correction**, based on [empirical frequencies](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) provided by Peter Norvig. As in the previous case-study, you will have to code it up and figure it out for yourself -- it is good for a warm-up, but challenging enough to keep you occupied.

:::



::: {.callout-note}
## Monty Hall. Simpson's Paradox and DAGs

The Simpson's paradox is usually introduced to highlight the importance of conditioning. However, the only resource I found which gets to the core of the problem is Bradley Neal's [first lecture](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course) on causal inference. 

The "paradox" part of it is resolved (or at least not puzzling), when we think about the causal structure of the problem (or the DAG of influences).
:::



::: {.column-margin}
This is completely optional, but I highly recommend the following provocative talk by 
Richard McElreath, "Bayesian inference is just counting" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rmcelreath/bayesian-inference-is-just-counting) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NEMHM1wDfI)). The understanding you'll gain from it will make learning Bayesian statistics much easier.
:::

## Bias-Variance. Fisher Information

I spend another lecture to deep-dive into estimators, because the concepts of bias-variance tradeoff and Fisher information have far-reaching consequences in a myriad of tools, applications and fields -- especially machine learning. It is also an appropriate point in time to introduce a technique which was revolutionary at its time: bootstrap.

There are objections to the Bias-Variance decomposition when seen as a tradeoff, in the context of Deep Learning -- however, in the most general sense, it is a universal problem not only in statistics, but also for human cognition. For an intuitive explanation, watch [lecture 8, slides](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html). See how this [tradeoff needs an update](https://www.bradyneal.com/bias-variance-tradeoff-textbooks-update) for the modern deep learning. 


::: {.column-margin}

This lecture is highly mathematical, but we will get some powerful intuitions about some fundamental tradeoffs we make in statistics, when selecting a model or estimator.

:::

- Bias-Variance decomposition and the curse of dimensionality
- Fisher Information and Rao-Cramer lower bound
- The Bootstrap scheme: motivation, applications, and limitations

::: {.callout-note}
## Bootstraping for Confidence Intervals

Bias-variance can be made more relatable in code, simulations, and visualization. However, I will not leave you hanging without introducing a technique you can use for solving practical and concrete problems, namely -- bootstrap.

:::


## Hypothesis testing. Neyman-Pearson

In order to make sense of frequentist hypothesis testing, I strongly recommend you read about the original idea of Neyman and Pearson (error control -- don't make a fool of yourself too often in the long run). It is a "path of action" perspective of statistics.

[This is certainly the most difficult lecture of the module, combining the math, programming, and even philosophy.]{.aside}

I start from the first principles and will let go of mechanical application of procedures and conventions (p-values, $\alpha, \beta$, test choice). You should to be able to justify all the choices you make during the phase of experiment design. 


- Picking a default action. [Type I, II errors](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/decerr.html). How costly is each type of mistakes?
- Minimal **effect size** of interest, [Cohen's](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/) $d$
- [Power Analysis](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/nhst/) and Sample Size justification. How surprising are significant findings under each hypothesis? Positive Predictive Value
- p-values [simulation](https://rpsychologist.com/pvalue/), [p-curve](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/pdist/) under $H_0, H_A$. 
- Confidence Intervals - first check out this [simulation](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/ci/).  Also [chapter 12](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/foundations-bootstrapping.html), uses bootstrap to estimate those. The tricky idea of "capture percent"


::: {.column-margin}
In order to put everything together, there are four resources I can recommend:

- Speegle's [book](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/HTCI.html) on data+probability+R
- Huber's [Chapter 6](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/06-chap.html) of Modern Statistics 
- [Statistical thinking for 21st century](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/ci-effect-size-power.html)
- [Improving your statistical inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Asking better questions

The most complicated part of hypothesis testing is asking better questions. I mean that in a highly technical sense, and whole-heartedly recommend you the following course from a TU Eindhoven professor, named ["Improving your statistical questions"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions/).

- Make riskier predictions: [Non-Inferiority testing](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/equivalence/), Equivalence Testing, Range predictions
- Publication bias, open science, pre-registrations
- Minimal Effect Size of interest: telescope method and resource-based
- Type 3 errors (solving the wrong problem)
- Read Werner Stahel's ["Relevance"](https://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/relevance/stahel-relevance2103.pdf) paper and Gelman's "Sign and Magnitude" [paper](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf)

:::


::: {.column-margin}

I think that the best way to start understanding inferential statistics is Daniel Lakens' book on "Improving your statistical inferences", combined with another resource like Speegle's "Probability, Statistics, and Data" for a deep-dive on technicalities.

:::


::: {.callout-note}
## A detour on the philosophy of science

- Understanding the philosophy of falsification and how it applies to hypothesis testing. [Week2 of this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions/lecture/j6Duu/lecture-2-1-falsifying-predictions-in-theory) has a great 20 minute explanation.
- Philosophy of science: Popper and Latakos, in this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvKG_3Ck7Y). "The null is always false"
:::


::: {.callout-tip}
## Common statistical tests are linear models

There is a zoo of different statistical tests and procedures, which might be very confusing -- especially trying to remember their particularities. It's important to realize that a lot of seemingly unrelated statistical tests in frequentist statistics are particular versions of linear models.

- [Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#1_the_simplicity_underlying_common_tests) and the [python port](https://www.georgeho.org/tests-as-linear/) 
- Choosing a statistical test: difference in proportions and means, test of $\sigma$, correlations
- For a bayesian alternative to t-tests, see [Krutsche's example](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/BEST.html)
- If you're not clear if your distributional assumptions hold, use a nonparametric test
:::


## Frequentism vs Likelihood vs Bayes

There are three main schools of thought in statistics, which have their [respective metaphors](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/qC3A1/frequentism-likelihoods-bayesian-statistics): "path of action" (Neyman-Pearson frequentism), "path of devotion" (Fisherian Likelihood), and "path of belief / knowledge" (Bayesian). I like very much the presentation of each school of thought in the book of Hastie/Efron "Computer Age Statistical Inference", [chapter 2, 3, 4](https://hastie.su.domains/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf). 

Each one has their strenghts, weaknesses, and contribute tools & insights for our future use-cases. When we got into the topic of A/B testing and experiment design, we unavoidably stumbled upon a few fascinating philosophical questions in relation to the nature of evidence. The philosophical debate is fierce, but in statistical practice, less so. I suggest a level of pragmatism to pick the right tool/perspective for the particular job. In the courses I teach, I dedicate quite a lot of time on how not to fall into the most common pitfalls when applying frequentist methods. It's an useful skill when critically reading the literature.


::: {.column-margin}
By now, you encountered the Neyman-Pearson (frequentist) approach. If you want another presentation, watch this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYcu3LoGqKc) by Zoltan Dienes to get a sense of the orthodox approach: its power and limitations.
:::

The likelihood approach is widely used in Machine Learning / Statistical Learning teaching and practice. This [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHFfJEvzPIo) by Zoltan Dienes contrasts Bayes Factors vs classical methods in t-test situations. 



::: {.callout-note}
## Three approaches to single-parameter models

We can pick a simple example of inferring a proportion, which has many practical applications that you might remember from "Distribution Stories". We care not just about the estimation, but also about confidence/credible intervals and the practical workflow.

- Frequentist: Normal Approximation, Agresti-Coull intervals
- Likelihood: Maximum likelihood, point estimates, bootstrapping. Check out [this interactive visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/likelihood/) an [lecture / lab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/8yZDk/likelihoods). 
- Bayes: The full posterior distribution, the tricky business of prior choice

## Dead Salmon Experiment. Replication Crisis 

Lastly, we can't avoid a conversation about the replication crisis happening in multiple disciplines, but especially in social sciences. What scientific literature can we trust? This is relevant not just for research and science, but will help you avoid many pitfalls in the business practice -- therefore, you will be less likely to be fooled by randomness.

- Multiple testing, p-hacking, HARKING, snooping. Ethics and Integrity
- Underpowered studies and vague questions
- Publication Bias, Open Science, Pre-registration and simulation
- False-discovery rate, Bonferoni correction
- Confounding, Mediation and all that causal jazz
- Computational Reproducibility vs Replication. Meta-Analysis


::: {.callout-note}
## Dead salmon experiment

An examination of a famous experiment in neuroscience, putting into question standard/current statistical practices, leads to a conversation of controversies in medicine, psychology, and social science. 

Just think about how important this experiment was for the field of medicine -- it won the [nobel prize](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/ignobel-prize-in-neuroscience-the-dead-salmon-study/)!

## "I haven't used Poisson outside that probability class"

If you empathise with this statement, you're either aware that it's important and wonder why it didn't come up in practice or believe it was a tedious academic exercise. The point is not about Poisson distribution, but about the statistical theory in general.

First, let me assure you that it is helpful in practical applications. The problem with the teaching is two-fold: the lack of stories / use-cases to motivate the theory and a lack of models besides linear regression, simple statistical tests, and ML models like gradient boosting and random forests.

Poisson distribution and process can be a good choice to model counts of **events per unit of time**, space, with a large number of "trials", each with a small probability of success.

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{e^{−\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}; \space k=0, 1, ...
$$

- Arrivals per hour: requests in a call center, arrivals at a restaurant, website visits. We can use it for capacity planning.
- Bankrupcies filed per month, mechanical piece failures per week, engine shutdowns, work-related accidents. We can use these insights to assess risk and improve safety.
- Forecasting slow-moving items in a retail store, e.g. for clothing. We'll investigate the **newsvendor problem** in excruciating detail, where we have to purchase the inventories ahead of time.
- A famous example is of L. Bortkiewicz: in Prussian army there were 0.70 deaths per one corps per one year caused by horse kicks. *("Law of small numbers")*.
- Number of asthma or kindey cancer related deaths per US county (examples in Gelman BDA3 recommended in Module 3)

Just before you get all excited about these applications, keep in mind that every distribution has a story behind it, and a set of assumptions that have to be met.
