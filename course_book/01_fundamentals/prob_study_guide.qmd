In the introduction and first module (business school for data scientists), I tried to convince you that data science and AI in businesses is about quantitative questions, decision-making, and improving outcomes. By walking through many use-cases in different domains, we saw how widespread are its applications and how valuable a data scientist could be to a firm.


Previous readings should give you enough motivation, context, and background to decide if you want to follow the proposed path. If the answer is yes, the question becomes how to actually do it^[As a reminder: ask the right questions, in order to build models which bring insight into the consequences of our actions, to improve  outcomes.] and where to start. There are two key insights to remember:

- Methodology, asking good questions, and problem formulation is what will make or break your project in practice 
- The importance of mastering the fundamentals

In the introduction, I highlighted two types of prerequisites, which roughly translate to hard skills and soft skills. The hard skills are linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, inferential statistics, and programming for data science. The soft skills have a big overlap with research methods, scientific thinking, and business understanding.

Before explaining how to study and what are the most important concepts and skills to develop in probability and statistics, I want to tell you two important lessons from Patrick Winston's talk at MIT, "How to speak": 

- The quality of your idea and solution is a function of knowledge, practice, and talent; where talent is the least important -- $f(\mathbb{K}, \mathbf{P}, T)$
- Your success will be largely determined by your ability to speak, write, and the quality of your ideas -- $g(S, W, Q)$


My point is that you need both: skills and understanding, soft skills and hard skills. Many mistakes in statistical modeling come from a misunderstanding of the nature of statistical inference. Other mistakes are not statistical, but a poorly formulated problem, which leads to using the wrong tool, or the right tool in an incorrect way. There is this always-present gap between the real world and mathematical abstraction.

## Prerequisites

The way you study probability and statistics will depend on your background. In terms of prerequisites, you need an exposure to linear algebra, calculus or mathematical analysis, and inferential statistics (hypothesis testing and linear regression).

In this module, I make little use of linear algebra or calculus, as it is an applied, not proof-based or theoretical course. However, if you never had those courses, it will be very difficult to understand the meaning behind mathematical notation and abstractions. If you never had a statistics class on hypothesis testing and linear regression, you won't know the pain. Jokes aside, it means you will need to use another resource provided in section iv, in parallel with this module.

You might be at a point in your studies, usually [second year of bachelor's degree]{.underline}, when you don't know how to code in Python or R yet, and have a probability & mathematical statistics class. Maybe you have another one on applied regression and econometrics as well. This is a perfect moment to study the module fully,^[for example, in a simulation or scientific computing class] in order to:

- Learn programming for data analysis in R or Python, including data wrangling, visualization, and reproducible research
- Apply theoretical concepts and models to real-world stories and case-studies. This will highlight why is that theory relevant, useful, and why was it invented in the first place
- Understand how and why the theory works by doing lots of simulations. Find out under what conditions it fails 

If you already had the classes mentioned above, you might be in third, 4th year, masters' degree, or finished your formal studies. It's likely you know how to solve problems and get stuff done in R or Python. Then, I recommend you go through this module in an accelerated way,^[for example, using some parts of the module as a review in the context of a data science or econometrics' class] both in terms of theory and coding. You might ask, why not skip it entirely and focus on statistical modeling?

- First, it's a good review and warm-up with fun and realistic case-studies. We all get rusty when not practicing for a while
- A much more important reason is the re-contextualization of the fundamentals and getting rid of misconceptions, bad habits, and questionable statistical practices
- I think that statistics is so tricky, that it's almost guaranteed we misunderstood something the first time we studied it


## Roadmap and the big picture

The module is build around stories and case-studies highlighting key concepts from probability theory, mathematical statistics, and applied regression modeling. We start from the very beginning, with counting and combinatorics, ending up with more sophisticated statistical models. 

There are a few purely theoretical lectures, but they are strictly necessary in order to combat common misconceptions and establish a correct, consistent terminology. The mind map below organizes the lectures into three main tracks: probability theory and simple Bayesian models, mathematical statistics and experiment design, regression modeling and estimation, sampling, optimization algorithms. 

Note that some case studies belong to and interact with other modules.^[This is a good thing, as our field is interdisciplinary. Moreover, if we strip the statistics out of context, we end up with a dry and abstract exposition] For example, in newsvendor problem and Wikipedia A/B test, we have to approach the problem from the perspective of businesses making decisions and carefully consider a few methodological aspects. There are a few simple Bayesian models, for inferring proportions and rates; elements of causal thinking and experiment design; and a gentle introduction to generalized linear models.

:::

These topics and case-studies are designed for a whole semester of intensive study. My promise is that by the end of it, you will become a more confident programmer and will have a very solid foundation for advanced statistical modeling, causal inference, and machine learning.

When teaching to masters' students, in the context of a data science class, I still feel it's necessary to walk through many of these aspects. What is sacrificed though, is depth and a limited amount of time available for students to practice on these case-studies. In my opinion, this is evidence that everyone can benefit from this module: undergraduate and graduate students, people already working in the field as data scientists and analysts. Even machine learning engineers. 


There is one more catch. For each of these topics and case-studies, you might feel the need to dive deeper into the underlying mathematics, philosophy, and explore more applications. In other words, many rabbit holes. Your feeling is correct, there is so much to learn and explore, but this should not intimidate you. Instead, let it serve as motivation, dive into a topic that resonates with you and see where does it lead.

Time, attention, and energy are the only constraints you should keep in mind while diving much deeper into your chosen topic.

## Learning how to learn

Consider the first lecture as a warm-up, where you have a chance to set-up your development environment and get into the flow of studying. I start with combinatorics, because there are several important concepts you might've missed or forgot, which have practical implications and pop up throughout the course.

Another goal of this lecture is to gain an appreciation and overcome the fear of mathematical abstraction and notation. We will see how these mathematical constructs and models have an underlying story and a reason for existence. By understanding the story and with a bit of practice, you will never, ever have to resort to rote memorization.

At last, I want to highlight that even these simplest tools, known for centuries, have real-world applications and were key to the development of the world as we know it today. ^[Think of geometry and cathedrals, apeducts, calculus, physics, engineering, industrial revolution, computers, and information technology] They look simple only in retrospective and we take them for granted. By connecting the appropriate abstraction (i.e. mathematical tool) to the phenomenon we want to explain and understand, we can make our scientific hypotheses precise and powerful. Urn models applied to physics are a great example of that. See the references in the "rabbit hole" section.


I think we have a problem in the teaching of mathematics to high-schoolers and undergraduates, where by applications is meant a numerical or toy example. Those are not applications! In the best case, they're stories and drills. Don't get me wrong, drills are important and we can't always do only what we like, but at worst, they're tedious, useless stuff assigned as homework which kills any passion.


It might sound obvious, but we practice in a very specific way -- with your reference book(s), code editor, and pen / paper at all times. Learn actively, by doing and problem solving, by testing yourself, by trying to come up with your own examples. We cannot afford to rush when studying mathematics and computer science.

## Combinatorics and sampling

Before jumping into the birthday problem, we need to know the stories behind core concepts in combinatorics, like ${n \choose k}$ "n choose k", factorial, falling factorial, and multiplication rule. We will then have to figure out how to apply these tools to ordered / unordered sampling with / without replacement. By learning the stories, you will never forget or misuse the mathematical relations:


- Multiplication rule and the "garden of forking paths". Ordered sampling with replacement: urns and balls, unique sequences
- Ways to order n people at a long bar table. Factorials
- Surveying only once, dealing cards from a deck, flags and poles. Sampling without replacement and falling factorial
- Splitting n people into two teams / subgroups of size k and r. Unordered sampling without replacement
- Story proofs of useful relations in combinatorics.
- Naive probability limitations and motivation for Kolmogorov's breakthrough of putting probability theory on a solid foundation

If you are studying probability theory and mathematical statistics right now, or feel the need to go through the most important topics again, I highly recommend these [lectures](https://www.santoshvenkatesh.com/video-lectures) by Santosh A. Venkatesh and Joe Blitzstein's [Probability 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home). You might rightfully object that no matter how amazing those courses and presentations are, it takes a lot of effort to work through them start-to-finish.

I encourage you to cherry-pick lectures where there are synergies with this course and could deepen your understanding. In my experience, the majority of people don't really get probability theory and mathematical statistics from the first time. It's partly because of an outdated way of teaching, partly because this stuff is really damn deep and complicated if you do it rigorously. 

There is absolutely no shame in going back to it again with a mindset of mastering the fundamentals. For me, this exercise turned out to be one of the most valuable things I studied. Also, understand that the resources I refer you to are a result of decades of teaching and research experience of those authors in top universities. For the purposes of learning probability, it's almost impossible to explain these topics better. Our only secret weapons are simulations and knowledge of what parts are most important and useful in practice. 



- Watch S. Venkatesh's introductory lecture on probability, called "Prelude to a theory of chance" (Tableau 1). 
- What is the difference between probability and statistics? Read this [short article](https://johnkerl.org/doc/prbstat/prbstat.html). Does your answer align?
- Watch J. Blitzstein's first [three lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo&si=t-fvklHEnNNPY_mX). Feel free to fast-forward and skip the things you already know well.
- Watch S. Venkatesh's lecture on combinatorics, Tableau 2. 
- Follow it up with the urn models in Tableau 3.

## Birthday Paradox. Pigenhole Principle. Collision Problems

One of the reasons we're not intuitively good at probability, is that in many cases it is difficult to count the way favorable/possible outcomes could occur. 

The birthday problem is one of such examples. We'll do simulations and derive the analytical solution -- suggesting unexpected applications in computer science and engineering.
:::

::: {.column-margin}
This is completely optional, but I highly recommend the following provocative talk by 
Richard McElreath, "Bayesian inference is just counting" ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/rmcelreath/bayesian-inference-is-just-counting) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NEMHM1wDfI)). The understanding you'll gain from it will make learning Bayesian statistics much easier.

::: {.callout-caution }
## Rabbit hole: unordered sampling with replacement

In Tableau 3, walk through the proof of unordered sampling with replacement, only if you find it interesting. The result will be useful only when we'll introduce bootstrap (explanation [here](https://rpubs.com/riazakhan94/bootstrap_distinct_sample))
:::

I understand if your reaction at this point is: "Are you kidding me, this is just a warm-up?". I would like to convince you that the time investment is not that big and the payoff is huge. In a formal classroom setting, we would spend 1h 20' in a lab, with roughly 2-4 hours of self-study and optional readings necessary for you to get a really good grasp on this. If you study by yourself, there are three lectures by J. Blitzstein (45' each), 3 tableaus by S. Venkatesh (1h each). There will be a huge overlap in the content and not all of it requires hands-on study. 

So, what do you get in return of this time investment? Fun stories and applications in multiple domains, confidence and not being scared of mathematical abstraction, courage to explore more. You might realize that probability and statistics don't have to be a chore, but a worthwhile and fascinating profession to pursue. Motivation makes all the difference, so we have good reasons to be disciplined and work hard.


## Binomial distribution. Probability trees. Simulation and LLN

The coin flip, which we'll call Bernoulli distribution, is one of the most useful mathematical abstractions, as binary outcomes are ubiquitous -- the event either happens or not, with a probability $\theta$. Think about a few examples from your day-to-day life and from the perspective of a firm.

If we have multiple independent events, each one being a coin flip, we can model the number of successes $k$ out of $n$ trials with the Binomial distribution. In order to apply what we learned about combinatorics, a good exercise is to derive its distribution (probability mass function) via a story proof. I want to remind you that probability is generative: if we know $\theta$ and $n$ we can simulate data / outcomes, and make predictions. 

::: {.column-margin}
In statistics, we estimate the parameters of (population) models from data (our sample). You will see the Binomial distribution a lot in hypothesis testing for randomized experiments and surveys. It will help you understand logistic regression.

## Couples showing up to a safari

In our case-study, we will try to find out what is the distribution of the number of people who sign up to safari and actually show up. We have only three seats available, $n = 3$. If people decide to show up independently, the problem is straightforward, as you can see in A. Fleischhacker's "Persuasive Python", [Chapter 2](https://www.persuasivepython.com/1-repuncertainty). Instead, I introduce a subtle change which will make the problem quite tricky.


In our version of the problem, a part of our potential customers are friends and couples making reservations for two. Of course, the events are now no longer independent: if one changes their mind and doesn't show up, neither will the other (or so we assume). 

There is one more gotcha. Even if we know the "prevalence" of couples in the target population, we still have to calculate the proportion of seats reserved by each type of customers. 
:::


In order to overcome these challenges, we will formalize the problem with the appropriate notation, make our assumptions explicit, use probability trees, Bernoulli and Binomial distributions. We'll end up with a nasty formula which can be interpreted as a mixture model. Then, given a range of prevalences and individual probabilities of showing up, we simulate the process and interpret the results, comparing them to the case in which all passengers were independent. 

In terms of programming, this case study teaches you how to create Quarto or jupyter notebooks in your IDE, how to import packages, work with data frames, functions, how to use vectorized calculations instead of for loops, manipulate data, make persuasive visualizations, and generate reproducible reports of your work. ^[This is a lot for a beginner, as one has to understand what each piece of code does and how they connect together. The only solution is to practice, try to solve it yourself, read the errors and documentation, look at similar examples. Be resourceful!]

We picked and assumed certain values for prevalence of couples parameter. What if we're terribly wrong? In order to assess that, a sensitivity analysis is needed. It will tell us at what proportion of couples in the population we start seeing dramatically different outcomes in terms of expected number of people who show up. There are two ways to compute it, depending on how the output of the simulation looks like:

- If the 10k simulation runs return only the PMF (distribution), we can leverage the formulas for calculating expected value and variance of an arbitrary discrete random variable.
    - In this case, in order to represent the uncertainty in the mean estimation due to simulation (sampling), we could compute the standard error and display confidence intervals as error bars. This sounds a bit shady to me and out of place for this lecture
- If the simulation stores all 10k runs, we can just take an average and the standard deviation of the data. For a grid of 50 possible values of the parameter, we work with 500k samples, which is not a problem for your laptop.
    - Here, we have a more natural solution for summarizing the distribution: with a mean and a highest density interval

At this point, a fair question would be "what if I got really really unlucky with the sample I got?". In our case, unlucky with the sequence of 10k random numbers we generated, in the sense of getting a result far from true mean. It is very unlikely, but not impossible. ^[When we move to the topics in mathematical statistics, we'll formalize this idea. But generally, it's a good practice to ask how surprising is the data under a null hypothesis.] There are two obvious ideas: increase the number of simulations and repeat those simulations under different seeds. It will work very well, but why?

::: {.callout-note}
## Law of Large Numbers

Law of large numbers is the reason why simulation works, and also the reason we need to be very careful when interpreting the means of small sample sizes. To illustrate the theorem, we will simulate iid (independent and identically distributed) samples from the Bernoulli and Poisson distribution of an increasing sample size. 

The graphs will show the formal idea of convergence in probability, and a rate at which we expect the average root mean squared error to drop. In other words, as n increases, sample mean will get closer to the population mean in the long run. Therefore, in simulation, we might find out that we don't have to worry about being too unlucky after a certain number of runs. 
:::

I want to emphasize once again, that most of traditional statistics rely on either exact results or asymptotic theory. We should be vigilent and recognize when neither holds in our applications. But this is a topic for another day.

::: {.callout-note}
## Universality of the Uniform

This little, but important theorem is the reason we can generate random samples from any distribution, if we have speudo-random numbers which are uniformly distributed.

## Rabbit hole: the hot hand strikes again

You might've heard about the hot hand fallacy. We model streaks of successful shots in basketball and ask whether streaks of $k$ are surprising. Read the original paper by Kahneman and Tversky and ignore the statistical test they designed.

Their insight that fans and experts in basketball massively overestimate the magnitude of this effect is fundamentally correct. However, what doesn't follow from their research is that there is no effect, which is pointed out by a few Bayesian statisticians in the recent years. The debate goes on, but the limitations of the original statistical test are undeniable

This is a true rabbit hole. Right now, we have the tools to simulte what can we expect if there was no effect or a small effect, but we can't design a statistical test yet. For that, refer to the last section in Tableau 10 of S. Venkatesh, Kahneman's original paper, and recent papers which challenge the statistical methodology and modeling approach based on which the original conclusion was reached.
:::

Despite the ongoing debate about the magnitude of the effect in the hot hand phenomenon, it is undeniable that such simulations are extremely valuable -- they prevent us from be fooled by randomness. Let's look at a few more examples:

- amateur traders might see "winning" patterns in stock markets which can be explained by a random walk
- policy-makers might not realize that amazing SAT performances in some schools with few students could be just due to small sample sizes
- in chess, some might attribute an observed pattern of ELO by gender to nonsensical explanations, when a simple simulation will show that an initial disparity in the number of players, combined with estimating a proportion in top k overall players results in similar patters.
- pollers might underestimate the support for a political party due to differential non-response
- medical research might overestimate the effectiveness of a treatment due to drop-out and censoring
- we might think there is an association between variables, when both can be explained by a common cause, a confounder

This is one of the key reasons to study probability, statistics, and do lots of simulations. We train our brain to spot biases in our reasoning and decision-making. Even though we will still make foolish mistakes, at least we have a method to slow down and check a statement systematically. In the words of Richard McElreath:

>  And with no false modesty my intuition is no better. But I have learned to solve these problems by cold, hard, ruthless application of conditional probability. There’s no need to be clever when you can be ruthless.

## Probability Triple. Random Variables. Statistical Models

If you understand and can explain the above ideas in a simple, yet rigorous way  -- you're ready for the journey. Otherwise, if it feels shaky[^shaky], here are some readings:

- Probability Triple and Random Variables - a quasi formal introduction is written in [this chapter](https://course.economic-cybernetics.com/01_fundamentals/stat_foundations.html) of the course website. From my experience, not many students have this understanding after their probability theory classes.
- Collectivity ("physical" structure), Statistical Population, Sample. We need to be a bit more precise in what we mean by a statistical model and a DGP. 
    - Defining the population and sampling process is a critical step in statistics. 
    - The population is the "contract" we're bound to when talking about inferences
    - It is a much more nuanced topic than it looks, explained well [here](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design.html) and [here](https://crumplab.com/statistics/04-SamplesPopulations.html).
- Parameter (Estimand), Estimator, Estimation/Statistic. Never confuse those! 


[^shaky]: Some of you might find reviewing this insulting because it's "trivial", or useless theory, or a frustrating reminder of probability classes. Please, bear with me -- because we will eliminate a whole class of errors practitioners make by not keeping these things in mind.


::: {.callout-important}
## Hypotheses, Process models, Statistical models

Some of the biggest debates in science, spanning across decades and causing much confusion and controversy could've been resolved much quicker by having this explicit distinction about Scientific Hypotheses, Process Models, and Statistical Models or procedures. 

I highly recommend this first [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs) by Richard McElreath, showing how tricky could it be to map the correspondences between these three.

## Newsvendor problem. Stories behind distributions

You studied the properties of a whole zoo of probability distributions, but then, in statistics, encountered just a few -- especially in the context of hypothesis testing. In Module 3 (Applied Bayesian Statistics) we will need to know the stories[^stories] behind most of them, since the goal will be to build custom models for each application. 

[^stories]: There are particular physical processes and phenomena (stories, in general) which underly the patterns we observe. Often, those patterns can be accurately described by a particular probability distribution, governed by its parameters

- Bernoulli, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Negative Binomial [^prob-simulations]
- Poisson. Limiting and Conditioning. Overdispersion
- Beta, Gamma, Exponential. Exponential Family and Information Theory
- Statistical superstars: $\chi^2_k$,  $t_k$, $N(\mu, \sigma)$, $F(d_1, d_2)$
- Weirdos: Mixtures, Dirichlet, Multinomial, Weibull, heavy tails
- Remember the differences between PMF, PDF, CDF, MGF, $\mathbb{E}$, $\mathbb{V}$, $\mathbb{E}g(x)$


[^prob-simulations]: Look at some [examples with simulations](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/probchapter.html#simulationsprob) and [stories](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/view) / applications with more math from Joe Blitzstein.

## Poisson and the Prussian army

Originally, Poisson distribution was used to estimate deaths by horses in the Prussian Army. Here is the [historical data](https://rpubs.com/SmilodonCub/567089) and a [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/poisson-distribution-from-horse-kick-history-data-to-modern-analytic-5eb49e60fb5f) telling the story.
:::

I limit the number of hands-on applications for this chapter/lecture, not only because of time constraints, but also because most use-cases come in Module 3, in the context of more realistic problems. I hope, however, that I sparked an interest about how to approach Probability, especially when we draw DAGs to tell stories.


## The most dangerous equation. CLT

Halfway in the module, we switch from Probability Theory to Mathematical Statistics. The goal is to develop the fundamentals needed for applied statistics, designing randomized experiments, and even machine learning. [^4]

- We continue with the key idea of estimators and sampling distributions, review laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem. See simulations [here](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/SimulationRV.html#centrallimittheorem).
- If you're interested in the underlying theory, I go on a technical detour about convergence types: in probability, in distribution, and almost-sure
- What does a statistician want? Review important properties of estimators.
    - For an accessible explanation of Bias, Consistency, Efficiency -- showcased with the corresponding R code, see [openforecast](https://openforecast.org/sba/estimatesProperties.html)

## The most dangerous equation

I think that ["The most dangerous equation"](http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8863.pdf) is a must read for anyone, not just practicing scientists and statisticians. The example I usually do a demonstration on is about the dubious U.S. policy of splitting the bigger schools.

I recommend you watch the whole playlist and work through the case studies: it is fun and an essential skill -- to call out the bullshit.

Online platforms which have to rank posts and comments, face the challenges of how to take the sample size into account. It depends, but for inspiration, see the hackernoon ranking algorithm.

## P-Values and error control

## Confidence intervals. When randomization fails

## Conditioning and Bayes Rule

There is a quote I like a lot: "Conditioning is the soul of statistics". The Bayes rule, which follows directly from the axioms of probability, is an essential in decision-making and the most important tool in this course -- both conceptually and technically. Any introduction to the subject will work out:

- A few excellent resources are Chapter 1/2 of [BDA3](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), or Chapter 1/2 of [Bayes Rules](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-2.html), or Chapter 1/2 of [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). They will teach you about:
    - Conditioning, Marginalization, Priors, and Updating
- If you prefer videos, enjoy the 3Blue1Brown [visual masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM) on how to think like a Bayesian or the explanation [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/R6nV5/bayesian-thinking).
- I introduce the idea of Likelihood, which would serve us in future use-cases. It is another important perspective over statistical modeling to consider

## Medical testing for rare diseases
**Medical testing** for rare diseases, hypothetical example with code in my [course repository](https://github.com/Bizovi/decision-making/blob/main/playground/02_bayes.ipynb). We use the same idea to reason about how confident are we our code has no bugs.

If you remember the Covid-19 rapid tests and their confusion matrices printed on instructions, you could've applied the same idea!

For the simplest models, one approach of comparing different hypotheses is Bayes Factors. However, these do not translate well in practice for more sophisticated, multilevel models. You can look it up in the following courses [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/supplement/IPkZK/assignment-2-2-bayesian-statistics) and [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian/home/week/3) for the theory and examples.

- If you're into betting and sports, can you replicate the analysis on other datasets? What are your options for data collection?
- For brevity, I won't elaborate much from now on, how to take an use-case and example to its limit. **If you're passionate about a particular topic -- go for it!**

## Monty Hall. Simpson's Paradox and DAGs

The Simpson's paradox is usually introduced to highlight the importance of conditioning. However, the only resource I found which gets to the core of the problem is Bradley Neal's [first lecture](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course) on causal inference. 

The "paradox" part of it is resolved (or at least not puzzling), when we think about the causal structure of the problem (or the DAG of influences).

## Bias-Variance. Fisher Information

I spend another lecture to deep-dive into estimators, because the concepts of bias-variance tradeoff and Fisher information have far-reaching consequences in a myriad of tools, applications and fields -- especially machine learning. It is also an appropriate point in time to introduce a technique which was revolutionary at its time: bootstrap.

There are objections to the Bias-Variance decomposition when seen as a tradeoff, in the context of Deep Learning -- however, in the most general sense, it is a universal problem not only in statistics, but also for human cognition. For an intuitive explanation, watch [lecture 8, slides](https://work.caltech.edu/lectures.html). See how this [tradeoff needs an update](https://www.bradyneal.com/bias-variance-tradeoff-textbooks-update) for the modern deep learning.

This lecture is highly mathematical, but we will get some powerful intuitions about some fundamental tradeoffs we make in statistics, when selecting a model or estimator.

## Bootstraping for Confidence Intervals

Bias-variance can be made more relatable in code, simulations, and visualization. However, I will not leave you hanging without introducing a technique you can use for solving practical and concrete problems, namely -- bootstrap.

## Hypothesis testing. Neyman-Pearson

In order to make sense of frequentist hypothesis testing, I strongly recommend you read about the original idea of Neyman and Pearson (error control -- don't make a fool of yourself too often in the long run). It is a "path of action" perspective of statistics.

[This is certainly the most difficult lecture of the module, combining the math, programming, and even philosophy.]{.aside}

I start from the first principles and will let go of mechanical application of procedures and conventions (p-values, $\alpha, \beta$, test choice). You should to be able to justify all the choices you make during the phase of experiment design. 


- Picking a default action. [Type I, II errors](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/decerr.html). How costly is each type of mistakes?
- Minimal **effect size** of interest, [Cohen's](https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/) $d$
- [Power Analysis](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/nhst/) and Sample Size justification. How surprising are significant findings under each hypothesis? Positive Predictive Value
- p-values [simulation](https://rpsychologist.com/pvalue/), [p-curve](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/pdist/) under $H_0, H_A$. 
- Confidence Intervals - first check out this [simulation](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/ci/).  Also [chapter 12](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/foundations-bootstrapping.html), uses bootstrap to estimate those. The tricky idea of "capture percent"

In order to put everything together, there are four resources I can recommend:

- Speegle's [book](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/HTCI.html) on data+probability+R
- Huber's [Chapter 6](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/06-chap.html) of Modern Statistics 
- [Statistical thinking for 21st century](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/ci-effect-size-power.html)

## Asking better questions

The most complicated part of hypothesis testing is asking better questions. I mean that in a highly technical sense, and whole-heartedly recommend you the following course from a TU Eindhoven professor, named ["Improving your statistical questions"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions/).

- Make riskier predictions: [Non-Inferiority testing](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/equivalence/), Equivalence Testing, Range predictions
- Publication bias, open science, pre-registrations
- Minimal Effect Size of interest: telescope method and resource-based
- Type 3 errors (solving the wrong problem)
- Read Werner Stahel's ["Relevance"](https://stat.ethz.ch/~stahel/relevance/stahel-relevance2103.pdf) paper and Gelman's "Sign and Magnitude" [paper](https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf)

## A detour on the philosophy of science

- Understanding the philosophy of falsification and how it applies to hypothesis testing. [Week2 of this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions/lecture/j6Duu/lecture-2-1-falsifying-predictions-in-theory) has a great 20 minute explanation.
- Philosophy of science: Popper and Latakos, in this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvKG_3Ck7Y). "The null is always false"

## Common statistical tests are linear models

There is a zoo of different statistical tests and procedures, which might be very confusing -- especially trying to remember their particularities. It's important to realize that a lot of seemingly unrelated statistical tests in frequentist statistics are particular versions of linear models.

- [Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#1_the_simplicity_underlying_common_tests) and the [python port](https://www.georgeho.org/tests-as-linear/) 
- Choosing a statistical test: difference in proportions and means, test of $\sigma$, correlations
- For a bayesian alternative to t-tests, see [Krutsche's example](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/BEST.html)
- If you're not clear if your distributional assumptions hold, use a nonparametric test

## Frequentism vs Likelihood vs Bayes

There are three main schools of thought in statistics, which have their [respective metaphors](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/qC3A1/frequentism-likelihoods-bayesian-statistics): "path of action" (Neyman-Pearson frequentism), "path of devotion" (Fisherian Likelihood), and "path of belief / knowledge" (Bayesian). I like very much the presentation of each school of thought in the book of Hastie/Efron "Computer Age Statistical Inference", [chapter 2, 3, 4](https://hastie.su.domains/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf). 

Each one has their strenghts, weaknesses, and contribute tools & insights for our future use-cases. When we got into the topic of A/B testing and experiment design, we unavoidably stumbled upon a few fascinating philosophical questions in relation to the nature of evidence. The philosophical debate is fierce, but in statistical practice, less so. I suggest a level of pragmatism to pick the right tool/perspective for the particular job. In the courses I teach, I dedicate quite a lot of time on how not to fall into the most common pitfalls when applying frequentist methods. It's an useful skill when critically reading the literature.

By now, you encountered the Neyman-Pearson (frequentist) approach. If you want another presentation, watch this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYcu3LoGqKc) by Zoltan Dienes to get a sense of the orthodox approach: its power and limitations.
:::

The likelihood approach is widely used in Machine Learning / Statistical Learning teaching and practice. This [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHFfJEvzPIo) by Zoltan Dienes contrasts Bayes Factors vs classical methods in t-test situations.

## Three approaches to single-parameter models

We can pick a simple example of inferring a proportion, which has many practical applications that you might remember from "Distribution Stories". We care not just about the estimation, but also about confidence/credible intervals and the practical workflow.

- Frequentist: Normal Approximation, Agresti-Coull intervals
- Likelihood: Maximum likelihood, point estimates, bootstrapping. Check out [this interactive visualization](https://rpsychologist.com/likelihood/) an [lecture / lab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/lecture/8yZDk/likelihoods). 
- Bayes: The full posterior distribution, the tricky business of prior choice

## Dead Salmon Experiment. Replication Crisis 

Lastly, we can't avoid a conversation about the replication crisis happening in multiple disciplines, but especially in social sciences. What scientific literature can we trust? This is relevant not just for research and science, but will help you avoid many pitfalls in the business practice -- therefore, you will be less likely to be fooled by randomness.

- Multiple testing, p-hacking, HARKING, snooping. Ethics and Integrity
- Underpowered studies and vague questions
- Publication Bias, Open Science, Pre-registration and simulation
- False-discovery rate, Bonferoni correction
- Confounding, Mediation and all that causal jazz
- Computational Reproducibility vs Replication. Meta-Analysis

## Dead salmon experiment

An examination of a famous experiment in neuroscience, putting into question standard/current statistical practices, leads to a conversation of controversies in medicine, psychology, and social science. 

Just think about how important this experiment was for the field of medicine -- it won the [nobel prize](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/scicurious-brain/ignobel-prize-in-neuroscience-the-dead-salmon-study/)!
